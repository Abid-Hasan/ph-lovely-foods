                    <h5 class="card-title">Chicken Handi</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">Take a large pot or wok, big enough to cook all the chicken, and heat the oil
                        in it. Once the oil is hot, add sliced onion and fry them until deep golden brown. Then take
                        them out on a plate and set aside.
                        To the same pot, add the chopped garlic and sauté for a minute. Then add the chopped tomatoes
                        and cook until tomatoes turn soft. This would take about 5 minutes.
                        Then return the fried onion to the pot and stir. Add ginger paste and sauté well.
                        Now add the cumin seeds, half of the coriander seeds and chopped green chillies. Give them a
                        quick stir.
                        Next goes in the spices – turmeric powder and red chilli powder. Sauté the spices well for
                        couple of minutes.
                        Add the chicken pieces to the wok, season it with salt to taste and cook the chicken covered on
                        medium-low heat until the chicken is almost cooked through. This would take about 15 minutes.
                        Slowly sautéing the chicken will enhance the flavor, so do not expedite this step by putting it
                        on high heat.
                        When the oil separates from the spices, add the beaten yogurt keeping the heat on lowest so that
                        the yogurt doesn’t split. Sprinkle the remaining coriander seeds and add half of the dried
                        fenugreek leaves. Mix well.
                        Finally add the cream and give a final mix to combine everything well.
                        Sprinkle the remaining kasuri methi and garam masala and serve the chicken handi hot with naan
                        or rotis. Enjoy!</p>

                    <p class="card-text">1 Preheat the oven to 230°C.

                        2 Add the sugar and crumble the fresh yeast into warm water.

                        3 Allow the mixture to stand for 10 – 15 minutes in a warm place (we find a windowsill on a
                        sunny day works best) until froth develops on the surface.

                        4 Sift the flour and salt into a large mixing bowl, make a well in the middle and pour in the
                        yeast mixture and olive oil.

                        5 Lightly flour your hands, and slowly mix the ingredients together until they bind.

                        6 Generously dust your surface with flour.

                        7 Throw down the dough and begin kneading for 10 minutes until smooth, silky and soft.

                        8 Place in a lightly oiled, non-stick baking tray (we use a round one, but any shape will do!)

                        9 Spread the passata on top making sure you go to the edge.

                        10 Evenly place the mozzarella (or other cheese) on top, season with the oregano and black
                        pepper, then drizzle with a little olive oil.

                        11 Cook in the oven for 10 – 12 minutes until the cheese slightly colours.

                        12 When ready, place the basil leaf on top and tuck in!</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Tip the bulghar into a pan, cover with water and boil for 10 mins. Drain really
                        well in a sieve, pressing out any excess water.

                        To make the tzatziki, squeeze and discard the juice from the cucumber, then mix into the yogurt
                        with the chopped mint and a little salt.

                        Work the bulghar into the lamb with the spices, garlic (if using) and seasoning, then shape into
                        4 burgers. Brush with a little oil and fry or barbecue for about 5 mins each side until cooked
                        all the way through. Serve in the buns (toasted if you like) with the tzatziki, tomatoes, onion
                        and a few mint leaves.</p>
